<h1>{ordinalsimr} Shiny Application</h1>
<p>The {ordinalsimr} package is intended to assist applied statisticians
with running simulation studies on ordinal data. This Shiny application
provides a point-and-click approach to setting simulation parameters
including setting the number of iterations, the total sample size, the
group size ratio between group 1 and group 2, and the distribution
probabilities of the ordinal endpoint for each group.</p>
<div id="help-files" class="section level2">
<h2>Help Files</h2>
<p>If the Shiny application is not flexible enough for your purposes,
this package also provides a variety of helper functions. See the
package for vignettes for more information on coding your own simulation
studies.</p>

<h2>Pages</h2>
<div id="simulation" class="section level3">
<h3>Simulation</h3>
<p>This page is for parameter entries, and includes a “Run Test” button
to press once all parameters have been determined. Processing is
completed when the p-value tables at the bottom of the page appear.</p>
</div>
<div id="distributions" class="section level3">
<h3>Distributions</h3>
<p>Results of a simulation run can be seen here included a visualization
of the p-value densities by test as well as Power, Type II error, Type I
error, and associated confidence intervals for these values. The CI
percentiles can be adjusted as well as the nominal significance level
.</p>
</div>
<div id="report" class="section level3">
<h3>Report</h3>
<p>Experimental page: will include a report generated from the
simulation results.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-download" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Download</h3>
<p>This page is under development, but does currently include an option
to download the metadata (i.e. input parameters), p-values from tests,
summary statistics, and the ggplot as an <code>.rds</code> file.</p>
